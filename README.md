# QubitVR
QubitVR will be the first educational simulation and visualization of quantum computing principles designed specifically for learning. It is also the first interactive virtual reality simulation of quantum computing.

My Roles: Project Manager, VR Developer, UI/UX Developer, Communications Liaison.

Led a team in the design and successful development of a virtual reality application that provides a three-dimensional space where users can directly interact with quantum bits, or qubits, and work with visual representations of how quantum phenomena affect these qubits.

• Enforced deadlines with a Gantt Chart,
• Ensured consistent project progress,
• Organized team meetings and updates,
• Maintained group files, submissions, and information.
• Established​ a novel VR toolbelt design that moves and rotates with the user,
• Created assessments with multiple choice and object selection functionality,
• Implemented method to dynamically rotate vector in scientifically accurate path for each state change,
• Developed in-game tool functionality.
• Refined the final qubit design,​
• Optimized laser pointer operation,
• Planned user flow of learning modules,
• Utilized Unity animations to enhance user understanding in tutorial.
• Coordinated meetings and contact with the project sponsors and professors,
• Set up and maintained team communication.
