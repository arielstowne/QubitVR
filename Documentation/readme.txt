DOCUMENTATION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reference code documentation, open folder \QubitVR\Documentation\html and select any .html  file. 
This will open the documentation page in your browser and grant access to the entirety of the Doxygen code documentation.
Refer to https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html for more information on Doxygen.

A pre-configured Doxygen config file has been included. 
CAUTION: ONLY MAKE CHANGES TO THE CONFIG FILE IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

Contents: 
	* All Javadoc comments from scripts located in Assets\Scripts.
	* Code structure & class inheritance

Note: 	Doxy documentation is a large task. There is much more that can be done to enhance this. 
	A word of advice: regularly re-run the doxywizard using the included config with up-to-date comments.

To reference guided documentation (e.g. "how-to" guides), open the folder QubitVR\Documentation\text.
